# Should I Move Here? (React-Redux)

A front-end React/Redux web application that asks the user to input a US city, then provides information related to the provided city.

This is an application I originally made using Javascript/JQuery during my coding bootcamp (my first group project). This repo is a re-make of that site I have made using the React framework, and Redux for state management. I also used this project to get more familiar with async/await,CSS grid, React Hooks, and using netlify's continous deployment tool.

## API's Used

- Zomato (Restaurants Information)
- DarkSky (Weather Information)
- OpenBreweryDB (Local Breweries)
- Google Places API (Autocomplete city search)
